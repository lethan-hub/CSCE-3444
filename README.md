# CSCE-3444 - Health Tracker

The Health Tracker is a Python-based application designed to help users monitor and improve their health.  This project focuses on simplicity and making tools for tracking personal health benchmarks easier â€“ like calorie intake, macronutrients, and exercise.

As many commercialized solutions exist, they are often too complex and require payment to receive the full features or lack the solution to the user's needs.  My team's solution provides user-friendly applications with features such as daily calorie tracking, macro breakdown (protein, carbs, fats), and exercise logging to support health-conscious individuals in achieving their fitness goals.
